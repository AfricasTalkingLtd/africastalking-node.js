# Official Africa's Talking Node.js API wrapper

The Africa's Talking Node API wrapper provides convenient access to the Africa's Talking API from applications written in server-side JavaScript.

## Documentation

Take a look at the [API docs here](http://docs.africastalking.com).


## Install

You can install the package by running: 

```bash
$ npm install --save africastalking
```

## Usage

The package needs to be configured with your Africa's Talking username and API key (which you can get from the dashboard).
In addition to the API key, there are a few other options you can set including the response format.

```javascript
const options = {
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',         // Use sandbox API key for sandbox development
    username: 'YOUR_USERNAME',      // Use "sandbox" for sandbox development
    format: 'json'                  // or xml
};
const AfricasTalking = require('africastalking')(options);
// ...
```

`Important`: If you register a callback URL with the API, always remember to acknowledge the receipt of any data it sends by responding with an HTTP `200`; e.g. `res.status(200);` for express.

### SMS

```javascript
const sms = AfricasTalking.SMS;
// all methods return a promise
sms.send(opts)
    .then(success)
    .catch(error);
```

#### [Sending SMS](http://docs.africastalking.com/sms/sending)

- `send(options)`: Send a message. `options` contains:

    - `to`: A single recipient or an array of recipients. `REQUIRED`
    - `from`: Shortcode or alphanumeric ID that is registered with Africa's Talking account.
    - `message`: SMS content. `REQUIRED`

- `fetchMessages(options)`: Manually retrieve your messages.

    - `lastReceivedId`: "This is the id of the message that you last processed". Defaults to `0`. `REQUIRED`


#### [Premium Subscriptions](http://docs.africastalking.com/subscriptions/fetchsubscriptions)

### [USSD](http://docs.africastalking.com/ussd)

> Processing USSD requests using our API is very easy once your account is set up. In particular, you will need to:
> - Register a service code with us.
> - Register a URL that we can call whenever we get a request from a client coming into our system.
>
> Once you register your callback URL, any requests that we receive belonging to you will trigger a callback that sends the request data to that page using HTTP POST.
> [Read more.](http://docs.africastalking.com/ussd)

If you are using connect-like frameworks (*express*), you could use the middleware `AfricasTalking.USSD(handler)`:

`handler(params, next)`: Process USSD request and call `next()` when done.

- `params`: contains the following user data sent by Africa's Talking servers: `sessionId`, `serviceCode`, `phoneNumber` and `text`.
- `next(args)`: `args` must contain the following:
    - `response`: Text to display on user's device. `REQUIRED`
    - `endSession`: Boolean to decide whether to **END** session or to **CON**tinue it. `REQUIRED`

```javascript

// example (express)

app.post('/natoil-ussd', new AfricasTalking.USSD((params, next) => {
    const endSession = false;
    const message = '';
    
    const session = sessions.get(params.sessionId);
    const user = db.getUserByPhone(params.phoneNumber);

    if (params.text === '') {
        message = "Welcome to Nat Oil \n";
        message += "1: For account info \n";
        message += "2: For lost gas cylinder";

    } else if (params.text === '1') {
        message = user.getInfo();
        endSession = true;

    } else if (params.text === '2') {
        message = "Enter 1 for recovery \n";
        message += "Enter 2 for lost and found";
        endSession = true;

    } else {
        message = "Invalid option";
        endSession = true;
    }

    next({
        response: message, 
        endSession: endSession
    });
}));
```
