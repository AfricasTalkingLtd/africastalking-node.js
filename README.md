# Africa's Talking Node.js SDK

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/africastalking.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/africastalking)

> The wrapper provides convenient access to the Africa's Talking API from applications written for Node.js.

## Documentation

Take a look at the [API docs here](https://developers.africastalking.com).


## Install

You can install the package from [npm](https://npmjs.com/package/africastalking) by running: 

```bash
$ npm install --save africastalking
```

## Usage

The package needs to be configured with your app username and API key, which you can get from the [dashboard](https://account.africastalking.com).

> You can use this SDK for either production or sandbox apps. For sandbox, the app username is **ALWAYS** `sandbox`

```javascript
const credentials = {
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',         // use your sandbox app API key for development in the test environment
    username: 'YOUR_USERNAME',      // use 'sandbox' for development in the test environment
};
const Africastalking = require('africastalking')(credentials);

// Initialize a service e.g. SMS
const sms = Africastalking.SMS

// Use the service
const options = {
    to: ['+254711XXXYYY', '+254733YYYZZZ'],
    message: "I'm a lumberjack and its ok, I work all night and sleep all day"
}

// Send message and capture the response or error
sms.send(options)
    .then( response => {
        console.log(response);
    })
    .catch( error => {
        console.log(error);
    });
```

See [example](example/) for more usage examples.
